# Tectonic

Sample Vulkan app based on the [Vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) that draws a triangle.

## Extension #1

Given that the code can successfully render a triangle, this repository also include the chapters following [Drawing a triangle](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Setup/Base_code) of the vulkan tutorial.

Thus the project includes concepts described until the [Multisampling](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Multisampling) chapter.

## Extension #2

Given that the code can successfully render a 3d object and applying a texture to it, we extend the tutorial with the following features :
